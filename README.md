## Movie diary 🎬

This project uses the [TMDB API] to create a simple movie diary app. 📺 The user can browse movies or search for a specific movie and they see the title, poster, rating and year of release of each movie.

The project is currently under construction. 🚧 In the future, the user will be able to:
* mark movies they want to watch and they will appear in the watchlist. 🍿
* track the movies they watched in their diary. They will be able to add watch date and rating. ⭐️
